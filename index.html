        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am originally from British Columbia, Canada, but now I live in Edmonton, Alberta.
<br />
I attended the University of British Columbia (Okanagan) where I completed my Bachelor of Arts, majoring in International Relations. Following that, I decided to enter a field where I could take advantage of my technology and design skills. I graduated with my Master of Library and Information Studies from the University of Alberta in 2014. 
<br />
<br />
I'm a perfectionist in almost every sense of the word, and I prefer to think big picture and long-term. During my academic and professional career, I've had the incredible fortune to serve in a variety of different roles. As a result, I have accumulated wide array of skills in the fields of information technology, academic research and publishing, web design and usability, customer service, and project management. I continue to maintain a willingness to learn and I am always working on a project or taking a course to further develop my skills and pursue my interests. If you are looking for someone who is interested in pushing the boundaries of your industry, then I am the person for you!
